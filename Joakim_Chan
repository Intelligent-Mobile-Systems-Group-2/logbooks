week 13
We in the app group decided to use flutter to create the app. 
This week has mostly been getting familiar with flutter and discussing how the app should look alike and creating a mock-up 
so the team has the same under on the view part.


week 14 
The first task I got is to create a GitHub environment for the team app.
We in the group also divided the view into different parts and I got to implement the joystick view.


week 15
After creating the view the next step is to make it so that the joystick generates input and output 
and communicates with the mower team to understand what data it needs from the app team.

week 16
After completing the joystick the next task I got was to create the Bluetooth view. 

week 17
This week we in the app group set a deadline that end of the week the Bluetooth should be complete, 
at least that the app and mower are able to pair with each other. 
After that, I will jump into API requests and begin to work with the backend.

week 18
End up that the Bluetooth still has some struggle when it comes to connection, 
but instead of the whole team focusing on one thing, I got sent to continue with the API for getting data from database. 
Same as other parts begin with the view and later try to fetch data from the database to show in the app.

week 19
This week I continued with API, where the app is going to collect data from the database and later on put it in the list, 
where the list contains coordinates that will be used to print out points on the map.
