### Mars 29 (29/2/22)

- I Set up a GitHub Organization as well as 3 repos: ***backend***, ***mower*** and ***app***. I invited all of the team members to the organization and we also set up a Discord server with corresponding roles.

- Set up a base development environment for the backend and pushed it to the repo.
